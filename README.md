# CIS-3050: Project 1

** Project 1 â€” Zozo Company Sales Process Database**

In this project, I designed a complete database management system for the fictional Zozo Company to support its sales process and data operations. I created conceptual, logical, and physical Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) using erwin Data Modeler and Microsoft Visio, defined key entities such as Region, Store, Product, Customer, Vendor, and Sales Transaction, and established relationships, primary/foreign keys, and referential integrity constraints.

The database schema was normalized and analyzed for functional dependencies, ensuring data integrity and eliminating redundancy. I also implemented a supertype/subtype model to distinguish between local and international customers. This project strengthened my understanding of data modeling, normalization, and business rule enforcement in relational databases.

Tools Used: erwin Data Modeler | Microsoft Visio | SQL | Relational Database Design Concepts
