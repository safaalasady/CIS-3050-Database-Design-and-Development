# Project 3 — Exploring Big Data and Its Application

In this project, I explored the concepts, technologies, and real-world applications of Big Data and how it differs from traditional relational databases. The report examined NoSQL databases, Hadoop, Hive, and MapReduce, discussing how they enable scalable storage and efficient processing of large, unstructured datasets. I also analyzed data analytics techniques—predictive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and descriptive—and their role in driving business decision-making.

Additionally, I created a star schema design, applied indexing concepts, and explained the roles of query optimizers, data warehousing models, and cloud computing approaches (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). This project integrated lessons from previous database design and SQL implementation projects, emphasizing how organizations like Amazon and Google manage and analyze massive data environments.
