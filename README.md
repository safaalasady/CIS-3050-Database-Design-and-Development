# Project 2 â€” Database Design and Implementation in Microsoft SQL Server

For this project, I implemented a fully functional relational database using Microsoft SQL Server to demonstrate real-world data manipulation and retrieval. I designed and executed 28 SQL queries applying key operations such as SELECT, JOIN, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE VIEW. These queries handled filtering, aggregation, formatting, subqueries, and view creation to generate meaningful business insights from multiple related tables.

Throughout the project, I analyzed query performance, joins, constraints, and recursive relationships, including one-to-many and manager-employee structures. I also resolved SQL execution conflicts and learned the importance of query order and logical flow. This experience solidified my ability to design, build, and query databases aligned with business rules and data-integrity requirements.
